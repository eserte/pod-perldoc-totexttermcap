This distribution contains the modules Pod::Perldoc::ToTextTermcap and
Pod::Perldoc::ToTextOverstrike. These are frontends to let perldoc use
Pod::Text::Termcap and Pod::Text::Overstrike.

My plan is to get these modules into the Pod-Perldoc distribution,
and thus into Perl5 core, to fix outstanding encoding issues in
Pod::Perldoc::ToText and/or Pod::Text, and eventually to replace
Pod::Man as default perldoc renderer by any of the two (I believe it
is not possible to have decent Unicode support with nroff).

The repository can be found at:
git@github.com:eserte/pod-perldoc-totexttermcap.git
